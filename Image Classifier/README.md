## Image Classifier - Tensorflow

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- `NumPy`
- `Pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `Tensonflow`
- `Tensorflow Hub`

Recommended to install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. Alternatively, you can make use of [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which allows you to write and execute Python codes in your browser.
